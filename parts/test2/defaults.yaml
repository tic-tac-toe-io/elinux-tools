# Add environment variables with default values when performing 
# the part hook scripts.
#
# For example, when you add a variable AAA_BBB in this configuration
# file under the part with name `xxx-yyy-zzz`. Then, in the hook
# bash script can use the environment variable XXX_YYY_ZZZ_AAA_BBB.
#
# And, this defaults file is an YAML configuration file, which can
# support primitive types. For example:
#
#  AAA: true
#  BBB: 12
#  CCC: goodbye
#
# The value of `CCC` variable is treated as a string, so you don't
# need "goodbye" with quote. For more details, please refer to 
# YAML specification.
#

#AAA: true
#BBB: 12
#CCC: goodbye
#DDD: https://en.wikipedia.org/
#
ABC: true
DEF: "--prefix=/usr/bin --no-systemd"
